    "Everywhere in the world can have a traffic accident, and there are many different things that cause the accident to happen, whether its weather condition, road condition (maybe there is a hole in the road, or the road slippery, etc), light condition (Daylight, Dark - Street Lights On, Dark - Street Lights Off, etc), drunk driving, and other things. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal is we want to reduce traffic accidents as much as possible by understanding what cause the accident to happen, and we can notif the drivers/people to be careful through mobile application like maybe google navigation, etc, if the condition at that time likely cause an accident to happen. \n",

So we will analyze the data to understand what caused an accident to happen, and what makes the accidents more severe.
